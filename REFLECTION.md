# Reflection on Trivia Game Project

## Author: Samridhi


This project involved creating a web-based **Trivia Game** with dynamic questions fetched from the Open Trivia Database API. 
Key features included 
- **user session management with cookies**, 
- **score persistence with localStorage**, 
- **dynamic rendering of questions and answer options**.  

## Objectives 
- Fetching data asynchronously with `fetch/async/await` and handling API.  
- Managing user sessions and persistent data in the browser.  
- Dynamically updating the DOM and handling form submissions with event listeners.  
- Calculating scores and maintaining a score table across sessions.  

## Challenges: 
- Ensuring scores persist even when starting a new player.  
- Handling multiple dynamically generated DOM elements correctly.  

## Outcome:
The game works as expected, remembering usernames, tracking scores, and allowing new players without losing previous data. 
This project strengthened my skills in **JavaScript, DOM manipulation, client-side storage, and event-driven programming**.
